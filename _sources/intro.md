# Water waves by Mike Cooke

My plan is to upload progress in my understanding numerical and theoretical work on water waves. I hope this is useful to others, but I will not hold my breath waiting for likes or dislikes.

If my previous efforts are a guide there will be no response. Further, I will no doubt lose interest at some point.

Initally (2025) there will be irrelevant fragments from the Jupyter Book template that should be ignored.
